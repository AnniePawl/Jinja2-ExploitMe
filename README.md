## Server-Side Attack Vectors 
- Lack of encryption (plain text passwords)
- Broken authentication workflows
- Session info not expiring or exposing user info
- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Request Forgery

## Template Injection 
Template injection occurs when user input is embedded in a template in an unsafe way. Template engines are used to present dynamic data via web pages. Unsafely embedding user input in templates enables **server-side template injection**. Template injections are used to directly attack web servers' internals and often obtain remote code execution (RCE). Often only apparent to people who look for it

### Template Injection Methodology
- **Detect**
  - Plaintext context: Most template languages used freeform 'text' context where you can directly input HTML. Template languages use syntax chosen not to clash w/ chars used in normal HTML. 
- **Identify**
  - Figure out which template engine is in use. 
- **Exploit**
  - Read the documentation (basic syntax, security considerations,lists of built-in methods, funcs, filters, vars)
  - Explore environment, figure out what you have access to. You will usually find default objects and app-specific objects passed into template. 
  - Attack when you understand attack surface

### Challenges 
- **Multiply 2 integers:** http://127.0.0.1:5000/?exploit={{2*7}}
- **Multiply an int and a str:** http://127.0.0.1:5000/?exploit={{2|string|int*7}}
- **Output hack.txt from local filesystem:**
